# **Create a Data Model for Seven Sages Tea Company**

Project 1 of Udacity's [Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization-with-power-BI-nanodegree--nd331)
in **Preparing and Modeling Data** course.

## Project Description:
The project is to create a Power BI data model and report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC). This data model will allow a company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea drinks are selling well and which ones are generating the highest profitability so they can make smart decisions about which products to prioritize as the company continues to grow.
The project demonstrates an understanding of basic data modeling principles, including the ability to clean, organize, and structure data in Power Query, create a date table, create a data model with appropriate relationships and filters, and create a simple report using common visualizations and DAX metrics.
